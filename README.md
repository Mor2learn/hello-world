# hello-world
This is my first try

I have been many things in my life. I am a mother to 4 amazing children (3 boys and 1 girl), grandmother to 4 gorgeous grandchildren (also 3 boys and 1 girl). I have recently become a kitten foster mom(3 boys and 1 girl) I seem to sense a theme here. I was a CNA for 8 years. It has taught me a lot of patience and making sure I put things back where I got them. 
I have to come up with a new career following a shoulder surgery. So I am trying to learn coding to be able to suppot the family I still have at home and those grandkids I love to spoil.
